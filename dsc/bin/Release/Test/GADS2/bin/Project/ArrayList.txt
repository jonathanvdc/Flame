    // Remarks:
    // The resulting array is not the backing array for this list, but rather an array whereto the elements of this list are copied.
    // This method was added to make copying an 'ArrayList<T>' easier.
    // Creating a new 'ArrayList<T>' from an array is also faster than creating an empty list and then adding every element from the original list, as the internal array will not need expanding.
