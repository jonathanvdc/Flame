/// Describes a generic read-only list that uses a list of the same element type as backing storage.

/// <remarks>
/// A read-only swap list's backing list can be changed by the client, but its elements cannot be modified by the client.
/// It may seem like this creates obvious loophole for list modification, as the client could retain a reference to the backing list.
/// The loophole is not reliable, however, as the class that contains the 'IReadOnlySwapList<T>' can also change the swap list's backing storage.
/// Thus, depending on said loophole could leave the client thinking they have a reference to the swap list's backing storage, even though they do in fact not.
